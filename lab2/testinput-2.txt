A test script to show a few simple tests for the SAS commands.
This is an example of a start to a test plan.  These tests are very incomplete.

Assumptions: these tests are designed with a list size of 3.  

TEST 1:  Add three entries to list.

To determine if test 1 passes look for three "Inserted new waiting SU" messages

TEST 2: Print the list and verify three entries are sorted 

PRINTASSIGNED
PRINTWAITING
STATS

To deterine if test 2 passes assigned list should have two users
The waiting list should have 1 user
Also, stats should show 3 records with an array size of 3

TEST 3:  Update the 111 entry in the list

ADDSU

To determine if test 3 passes look for "Updated assigned SU" message

TEST 4: Print the list, verify entry for 111 replaced

PRINTASSIGNED
STATS

To determine if test 4 passes look for 2 records, and 111 record should be 
updated with Time as 4.  Stats should still be 3 records, size 3

TEST 5: look for a record in the list and one not in list

LISTCH 1
LISTCH 2
LISTCH 3

To determine if test 5 passes it should print one record on channel 1 and
one records on channel 2.  No records on channel 3

TEST 6:  Attempt to add fourth record. If list size is 3 then add will be rejected

TEST 7: Remove the last element in the list and try to remove an element 
not in the list

DELSU 551
DELSU 552
PRINTASSIGNED
PRINTWAITING

To verify test 7, should see removed 551, did not remove 552, and final list
should be printed with 2 records.

TEST 8: Test changing channels

TEST 9: Quit

to verify test 9, run with valgrind and confirm there are no memory leaks
