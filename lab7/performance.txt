(1) For the retrieve driver, the results for different input parameters are shown below. Since we were using a bad combination for some of the tests, I used a load factor of 0.5 to help ensure it wouldn't create an endless loop and crash. We can see that the data closely matches the predictions, especially when the load factor is around half. In the first case, we have an average of 2.50788 which is only 0.00788 off from the predicted value. The amount of error between the measured and predicted values stay within 0.1 average probes. This small discrepency may be due to the fact that the predicted value is what the measured data should tend towards, but it will never be perfect.

(2) The table below shows the recorded values for trials done with various combinations of probing and table builds. The table entries also include the big-O that the value suggests. For some values, such as 190, it is unclear what the performance is, so it is categorized as O(?) which is some other complexity class. In general, values near 1 have a O(1), values in the 100s have O(?), and values in the 10,000s have O(n). For all schemes, when the keys are random the performance looks like O(1), which is desired. But, as the build gets worse, probing sequences like linear perform poorly and tend towards O(n). In general, it seems that double hashing has the best performance overall.


Successful
		random			sequential		folded			worst
Quadratic	2	O(1)		1	O(1)		119	O(?)		11652	O(n)
Double		2	O(1)		1	O(1)		2	O(1)		16	O(1)
Linear		4	O(1)		1	O(1)		13928	O(n)		27852	O(n)


Unsuccessful
		random			sequential		folded			worst
Quadratic	8	O(1)		190	O(?)		190	O(?)		8	O(1)
Double		7	O(1)		18	O(1)		17	O(1)		12	O(1)
Linear		23	O(1)		23669	O(n)		23728	O(n)		23724	O(n)



(3) When the table size is large and the number of trials is large, performance will be poor. This is shown in the equilibrium driver results below for trials 50,000 and 100,000. Before rehashing, it can be seen that the 50,000 trial test takes 107ms, while the 100,000 trial test takes 670ms. This is because many of the table keys are marked as deleted, which will hurt performance. In the first test, the percent of deleted location is 81%, which is better than 96% in the second test. This can be solved by rehashing every now and then. After rehashing, the time for the first test goes back down to 26ms and 44 for the second test.
